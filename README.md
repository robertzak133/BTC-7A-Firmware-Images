## Download Instructions
- Find the copy of brnbtc70.BRN file you're interested in one of the folders here
- Click on it; then press "Download"
- Copy this file onto an SD card at the "top level" (not into a folder on SD card).  You can do this without physically swappming SD card around by plugging the BTC-7A into a USB port on your computer, and copying the brnbtc70.BRN file into the folder which appears with the camera
- Note -- the file must be named "brnbtc70.BRN".  Sometimes downloading from your browser will add extra characters to distinguish it from previous downloads -- e.g. "brnbtc70(1).BRN".  If this happens, rename file to "brnbtc70.BRN" on the SD card. 

## FW install Instructions
On BTC-7A
- Press "Mode" 
- Select "CAMERA SETUP"
